## Getting Started
The first step is to create an element with a class of <code>.row</code> applied to it. Doing this will create a grid wrapper to to contain your grid columns.

Next step is to add divs with appropriate column classes (<code>.col-mobile-#</code>, <code>.col-tablet-#</code>, <code>.col-desktop-#</code>, <code>.col-hd-#</code>) within the <code>.row</code> element.

Grid classes apply to devices with screen widths greater than or equal to the breakpoint.

Applying a <code>.col-mobile-#</code> class to an element will not only affect its styling on mobile devices but also on tablet, desktop and extra large devices like TVs, unless overrides are specified per breakpoint (<code>.col-tablet-#</code> and/or <code>.col-desktop-#</code> and/or <code>.col-hd-#</code>).
