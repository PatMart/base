## Overview
Base includes a precompiled stylesheet which includes all the core ingredients to get you started, from typography to the advanced grid system.

**So what is exactly in the core ingredients?!**<br>
The super slim, sexy CSS includes the following:
* Basic resets
* Micro clearfix for clearing floats
* Typography (body copy, headings, small, sup, etc)
* Lists (unordered, ordered and definition lists)
* Blockquotes
* Tables
* Code and pre blocks
* Forms and buttons
* Grid
* General helpers
* Love and happiness :)

**Basic resets and helpers**<br>
The basic resets include a customised version of <code>normalise.css</code> to ensure all elements behave correctly across all browsers supported. 

**Micro clearfix**<br>
The clearfix hack is a quick and easy way to contain floats without resorting to using presentational markup.

**Typography**<br>
A basic set of styles are applied to general body copy, headings (h1 - h6) and links. Typography can easily be modified by tweaking the appropriate variables such as: @base-font-family, @base-font-size, @base-line-height and @link-color. These variables can be found within <code>_variables.less</code> or <code>_variables.sass</code>.
