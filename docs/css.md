## Basic resets
The basic resets include a customised version of <code>normalise.css</code> to ensure all elements behave correctly across all browsers supported.

## Micro clearfix
The clearfix hack, by [@necolas](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/), is a quick and easy way to contain floats without resorting to using presentational markup.

## Typography
A basic set of styles are applied to general body copy, headings (h1 - h6) and links. Typography can easily be modified by tweaking the appropriate variables such as: @base-font-family, @base-font-size, @base-line-height and @link-color. These variables can be found within <code>_variables.less</code> or <code>_variables.sass</code>.

The base font size is set at 16 pixels (using rem units) and the default line height is set to 22 pixels (using rem units).


## Lists
Styles for unordered lists, ordered lists and definition lists.

## Blockquotes
Basic styling for highlighting testimonials or quotes.

## Tables
There are 2 sets of styles for tables â€“ stripped pattern and line spearated for presenting your data in the most simplistic manner.

## Code and pre blocks
Core styling for code and pre block elements.

## Forms and buttons
Includes minimal styles for labels, input fields, select boxes and form buttons.

## Grid
